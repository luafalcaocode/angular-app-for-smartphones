# angular-app-for-smartphones
My Angular web project for small devices destinated to help to share info about missing people at Brazil.

This project was built with ANGULAR 8 using Angular Material library and I make an integration with a ASP .NET Core API. The user interface was design for smartphones resolutions and in the future will be publish at Play Store and Apple Store running inside Webviews - a platform that allow us to run web code as a mobile app.
