# angular-app-for-smartphones
My Angular web project for small devices destinated to help to share info about missing people at Brazil.

This project was built with ANGULAR 8 using Angular Material library and I'm making an integration with a ASP .NET Core API. The user interface was designed for smartphones resolutions and in the future will be published at Google Play Store and Apple Store running inside Webviews - a platform that allow us to run web code as a mobile app.

This service when be finished will be free and available for every person at Brazil and I hope it helps with the Missing Person problem in some way.

## Running this project:

- clone this repository using Git command line or a graphical tool
- navigate to the folder of the repository
- run at command line npm install for dependencies
- run ng serve --o to see in a browser
- press F12 and use simulator resolution for a better experience

## Available features:
- User registration with verification code

Obs.: All information available at this moment in the app are just samples of fake data to seed the application along de development and tests. 
Obs2: if the app crashes just hit F5! Bugs can happens until we finish the project! ;)
