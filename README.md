# angular-app-for-smartphones
My Angular web project for small devices destinated to help to share info about missing people at Brazil.

This project was built with ANGULAR 8 using Angular Material library and I'm making an integration with a ASP .NET Core API. The user interface was designed for smartphones resolutions and in the future will be published at Google Play Store and Apple Store running inside Webviews - a platform that allow us to run web code as a mobile app.

This service when be finished will be free and available for every person at Brazil and I hope it helps with the Missing Person problem in some way.
